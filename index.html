            <h2>About VSCO App</h2>
            <p>Launched in 2012, VSCO is an app which was developed by Visual Supply Company. It enables the users to capture pictures from their smartphone and edit them by applying different filters. You can use different tools to add special touches to your image. This app is supported in both iOS and Android operating systems. This application also allows the user to share their captured and edited images with other users on the service. The toolkit provides you with customisations to fade, tint, temperature, highlights, shadows, sharpness, exposure etc. Also, this app allows you to select photos as well as short videos or GIF's from your camera roll and edit them as per your taste. You can take your videos from camera roll and edit them but you cannot post them on your VSCO account. However, you can post the photos you capture or edit in VSCO. This app rolled a new feature recently called 'Montage' which will enable the users to edit photos and videos together in a single video just like photo collages. The best thing about this feature is that you can choose if you want to have the video in a portrait or a landscape view. You can also set the aspect ratio as per your desire.
